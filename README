:Abstract:
    forgetSQL is a Python module for accessing SQL databases by creating
    classes that maps SQL tables to objects, normally one class pr. SQL
    table. The idea is to forget everything about SQL and just worrying
    about normal classes and objects.

.. contents:: Contents


Installation
============

Installation of the forgetSQL module is pretty straight
forward:
    
    python setup.py install

This will install forgetSQL.py into site-packages/ of your 
Python distribution.


Dependencies
------------

* Python 2.2.1 (True/False, new style classes, classmethods, iterators)
* Some database module (tested: MySQLdb, psycopg)

If using psycopg, mx.DateTime is needed to avoid a psycopg
bug related to re-inserting dates. psycopg depends on mx.DateTime, so
that shouldn't be a problem.


What is forgetSQL?
==================

Why forgetSQL?
--------------

Let's start by showing an example using an imaginary database
'mydatabase':

This example is based on these SQL tables:

    account
    =======

    accountid    fullname      groupid
    ----------------------------------
    stain        Stian Søiland      15
    magnun       Magnus Nordseth    15
    stornes      Sverre Stornes     17
    mjaavatt     Erlend Mjaavatten  15


    group
    =====

    groupid  name 
    ----------------
    15       unix 
    17       tie

And should output something like:

    Account details for Stian Søiland
    Group unix (15)
    Other members:
    Magnus Nordseth
    Erlend Mjaavatten


In regular SQL programming, this could be done something like this:

    cursor = dbconn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT fullname,groupid FROM account WHERE accountid=%s", 
                   ('stain',))    
    fullname,groupid = cursor.fetchone()
    print "Account details for", fullname

    cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM group WHERE groupid=%s" % groupid)
    (groupname,) = cursor.fetchone()
    print "Group %s (%s)" % (groupid, name)

    cursor.execute("""SELECT fullname 
                      FROM account JOIN group USING (groupid)
                      WHERE group.groupid=%s AND
                            NOT account.accountid=%s""",
                   (groupid, accountid))
    print "Other members:"
    for (membername,) in cursor.fetchall():
        print membername


Now, using forgetSQL:

    from mydatabase import *
    account = Account("stain") # primary key
    print "Account details for", account.fullname
    group = account.group
    print "Group %s (%s)" % (group.name, group.groupid)
    print "Other members: "
    
    for member in group.getChildren(Account):
        # find Account with group as foreign key
        if member <> account:
            print member.fullname


Notice the difference in size and complexity of these two examples.

The first example is tightly bound against SQL. The programmer is forced
to think about SQL instead of the real code. This programming style 
tends to move high-level details to SQL, even if it is not neccessary.
In this example, when getting "other members", the detail of skipping
the active user is done in SQL. 

This would hardly save any CPU time on modern computers, but has made
the code more complex.  Thinking in SQL makes your program very large,
as everything can be solved by some specialized SQL. Trying to change 
your program or database structure at a later time would be a nightmare.

Now, forgetSQL removes all those details for the every-day-SQL tasks. It
will not be hyper-effective or give you points in the
largest-join-ever-possible-contest, but it will help you focus on what
you should be thinking of, making your program work.

If you at a later point (when everything runs without failures)
discovers that you need to optimize something with a mega-query in SQL,
you could just replace that code with regular SQL operations.
Of course, if you've been using test-driven development (like in 
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming ) your tests will show if
the replaced code works.


What does forgetSQL do?
-----------------------

For each table in your database, a class is created. Each instance of these
classes refer to a row in the given table. Each instance have attributes
that refer to the fields in the database. 

So accessing a column of a row is simply accessing the attribute
row.column.  Now, if this column is a reference to another table, a
foreign key, instead of an identifier you will in row.column find an 
instance from the other table, ie. from the other class.

This is what happens in the example above, group = account.group
retrieves this instance. Further attribute access within this instance
is resolved from the matching row in the group table.

If you want to change some value, you could just change the attribute
value. In the example, if you want to change my name, simply run
account.fullname = "Knut Carlsen" (my boss). 

You can retrieve every row in some table that refers to the current
object. This is what happens in group.getChildren(Account), which will
return a list of those Accounts that have a foreign key refering to
group. 

If you retrieve the objects several times, the constructor will return
the same object the second time (unless some timeout has expired). This
means that changes done to the object is immediately visible to all
instances. This is to reflect normal behaviour in object oriented
programming.  

    >>> stain = Account("stain")
    >>> stain2 = Account("stain")
    >>> stain.fullname = "Knut Carlsen"
    >>> print stain2.fullname
    Knut Carlsen


What does forgetSQL not do?
---------------------------

forgetSQL is not a way to store objects in a database. It is a way to
use databases as objects. You cannot store arbitrary objects in the
database unless you use pickling.

forgetSQL does not help you with database design, although you might
choose a development style that uses regular classes and objects at
first, and then design the database afterwards. You could then change
your classes to use forgetSQL for data retrieval and storage.

forgetSQL does not remove the need of heavy duty SQL. In some
situations, SQL is simply the best solution. forgetSQL might involve
many SQL operations for something that could be done in a single
operations with a large magic query. If something does not scale up
with forgetSQL, even if you refactored your code, you might try using
SQL instead.  This example would use excessive time in a table with a
million rows:

    for row in table.getAll():
        row.backedUp = True
        row.save()

This would involve creating one million object instances (each row), one
million SELECTs (to get the other values that needs to be saved), and
one million UPDATEs.  By using getAllIterator you could reduce this to
just one million UPDATEs (one SELECT, reusing the same object), but
still it would be far much slower than UPDATE table SET backedUp=true.

forgetSQL does not support commits/rollback. This might be implemented
later, but I'm still unsure of how to actually use this in programming.
Any suggestions are welcome.

forgetSQL does not ensure that objects in memory are in sync with what
is stored in the database. The values in the object will be a snapshot
of how the row were at the time you first tried to retrieve an
attribute. If you change some value, and then save the object, the row
is updated to your version, no matter what has happened in the database
meanwhile. An object does not timeout while in memory, it does not
refresh it's values unless you call _loadDB() manually, as this could
confuse programmers. In a future version of forgetSQL, this might not be
a problem.


Usage
=====

forgetsql-generate
------------------

Before you can use forgetSQL, you will need to generate a module
containg the classes representing database tables. Luckily, forgetSQL
ships with a program that can do this for you by guessing.

The program is called forgetsql-generate and should be installed by
setup.py or the packaging system. You might need the devel-version of
the forgetSQL package.

Create a file tables.txt, with a list of database tables, one per
line. (This is needed since there is no consistent way to query a
database about it's tables)

Then generate the module representing your tables:

forgetsql-generate --dbmodule psycopg --username=johndoe
                     --password=Jens1PuLe --database=genious
                     --tables tables.txt --output Genious.py

Alternative, you could pipe the table list to forgetsql-generate 
and avoid --tables - and likewise drop --output and capture stdout 
from forgetsql-generate.

The generated module is ready for use, except that you need should
set database connecting details. 

mydatabase._Wrapper.cursor to a cursor method, and
mydatabase._Wrapper._dbModule to the database module used:

    import mydatabase
    import psycopg
    conn = psycopg.connect(user="blal", pass="sdlksdlk", blabla)
    mydatabase._Wrapper.cursor = conn.cursor()
    mydatabase._Wrapper._dbModule = psycopg

This should be refactored to a more userfriendly interface.    


Normal use
----------

We'll call a class that is a representation of a database table a
forgetter, because it inherits forgetSQL.Forgetter.
This chapter will present normal usage of such forgetters by examples.

Getting a row by giving primary key
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

    account = Account("stain")
    print account.fullname

If the primary key is wrong (ie. the row does not exist) accessing
account.fullname will raise forgetSQL.NotFound. The object is not loaded
from the database until a attribute is read. (delayed loading)

To test if the primary key is valid, force a load:

    account = Account("stain")
    try:    
        account.load()
    except forgetSQL.NotFound():
        print "Cannot find stain"
        return


Getting all rows in a table
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

    allAccounts = Account.getAll()
    for account in allAccounts:
        print account.accountid, account.fullname

Note that getAll is a class method, so it is available even before
creating some Account. The returned list will be empty if nothing is
found.


To create a new row in a table
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

    account = Account()
    account.accountid = "jennyme" # primary key
    account.fullname = "Jenny Marie Ellingsaeter"
    account.save()

If you have forgotten to set some required fields, save() will fail. If
you don't set the primary key, forgetSQL will try to guess the sequence
name (tablename_primarykey_seq) to retrieve a new one. This might or
might not work. For MySQL some other magic is involved, but it should
work.


Change some attribute
'''''''''''''''''''''

    account = Account("stain")
    account.fullname = "Stian Stornes" # got married

You can choose wether you want to call save() or not. If you don't call
save(), the object will be saved when the object reference disappaers
(ie. del account, end of function, etc.) and collected by the garbage
collector. Note that this might be delayed, and that any errors 
will be disgarded.

If you are unsure if you have used the correct datatype or want to
catch save-errors, use save():

    group = Group(17)
    group.accountid = 'itil' # a string won't work in a integer field
    try:
        group.save()
    except Exception, e:
        print "Could not save group %s: %s" % (group, e)

The exception raised will be database module specific, like
psycopg.ProgrammingError, possible containing some useful information.


Undoing an attribute change
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you changed an attribute, and you don't want to save the change to
the database (as this will happen when the garbage collector kicks in),
you have two choices:
    
 * reset the instance to a blank state:
     group.reset() 
   This sets everything to None, including the primary key. 
   If you have referenced the instance anywhere else, they 
   will now experience a blank instance. 

* reload from database:
    group.load()
  Note, load() will perform a new SELECT.  

Note that you don't have to reset() if you haven't changed any
attributes, the instance will only save if anything has changed. 


Access foreign keys
'''''''''''''''''''

    account = Account("stain")
    print account.group.accountid
    print account.group.name

An attribute which is a foreign key to some other table will be
identified by the forgetSQLgenerator if it's name is something like 
other_table_id. If the generator could not identify foreign keys
correctly, modify _userClasses in the Forgetter. (See ''Specializing the
forgetters''). 

To access the real primary key, use account.group.accountid or
account.group._getID(). Note that the latter will return a tupple
(in case the primary key contained several columns).o

You can set a foreign key attribute to a new object from the
foreign class:

    import random
    allGroups = Group.getAll()
    for account in Account.getAll():
        # Set the group to one of the Group instances
        # in allGroups
        account.group = random.choice(allGroups)
    del account
    # Note that by reusing the account variable all of these
    # will be saved by the garbage collector

or to just the foreign primary key:

    account.group = 18

Note that this referencing magic makes JOIN unneccessary in many cases,
but be aware that due to lazy loading (attributes are not loaded from
database before they are accessed for the first time), in some cases
this might result in many SELECT-calls. There are ways to avoid this,
see ''Wrapping SQL queries''.


Finding foreign keys
''''''''''''''''''''

You might want to walk in reverse, finding all accounts that have a
given group as a foreign key.

    group = Group(15)
    members = group.getChildren(Account)

This is equivalent to SQL:
    SELECT * FROM account WHERE groupid=15


Deleting an instance
''''''''''''''''''''

Note that although rows are represented as instances, they will not be
deleted from the database by dereferencing. Simply removing a name
binding only removes the representation. (and actually forces a 
save() if anything has changed).

To remove a row from the database:
    
    account = Account("stornes")
    account.delete()
    
delete() might fail if your database claims reference integrity but does
not cascade delete:

    group = Group(17)
    group.delete()
    

Advanced use
------------

WHERE-clasules
''''''''''''''

You may specify a where-sentence to be inserted into the SELECT-call of
getAll-methods:

    members = Account.getAll(where="groupid=17")

Note that you must take care of proper escaping on your own by using
this approach. Most database modules have some form of escape functions.

In many cases, what you want to do with WHERE is probably the
same as with getChildren():
    
    group = Group(17)
    members = group.getChildren(Account)

This will be as effective as generating a WHERE-clasule, since
group.load() won't be run (no attributes accessed, only the primary
key).

The sentence is directly inserted, so you need to use the actual SQL
column names, not the attribute names. You can use AND and OR as you
like.

If you have several clauses to be AND-ed together, forgetSQL can do this
for you, as the where-parameter can be a list:

    where = []
    where.append("groupid=17")
    if something:
        where.append("fullname like 'Stian%'")
    Account.getAll(where=where)


Sorting
'''''''

If you have specified _orderBy (see '''Specializing the forgetters'''),
the results of getAll* and getChildren will be ordered by those
attributes. 

If you want to specify ordering manually, you can supply a keyword
argument to getAll:
    
    all = Account.getAll(orderBy="fullname")

The value of orderBy could be either a string (representing the object
attribute to be sorted) or a tupple of strings (order by A, then B,
etc.). Note that you can only order by attributes defined in the given
table.    
    
If you want some other sorting, sort the list after retrieval using
regular list.sort().

    all = Account.getAll()
    all.sort(lambda a,b:
                cmp(a.split()[-1],
                    b.split()[-1]))
    # order by last name! :=)                


More getAll
'''''''''''

There are specialized getAll methods for different situations.

If you just want the IDs in a table:

    >>> all = Account.getAllIDs()
    ['stornes', 'stain', 'magnun', 'mjaavatt']

The regular getAll() runs getAllIDs, and returns a list of instances
based on those IDs. The actual data is not loaded until attribute
access. In some cases, this might be OK, for instance if you want to
call getChildren and really don't care about the attribute values.

If you are going to iterate through the list, a common case, use
instead:

    for account in Account.getAllIterator():
        print account.fullname    

This will return an iterator, not a list, returning Account objects.
For each iteration, a new instance is returned, with all fields
loaded. Internally in the iterator, a buffer of results from SELECT * is
contained.

In Python, object creation is a bit expensive, so you might reuse the
same object for each iteration by creating it first and specifying it 
as the keyword argument useObject:

    for account in Account.getAllIterator(useObject=Account()):
        print account.fullname

Note that changes made to account in this case will be flushed unless
you manually call save(). Do not pass this instance on, as it's content
will change for each iteration.

Finally, getAllText() will use _shortView (See '''Specializing the
forgetters''') and return tupples of (id, text). This is useful for a
dropdown-list of selctors.
